**OpenSMAD** is an open-core, integrated software ecosystem designed to **democratize and streamline the end-to-end space mission design process**—from concept exploration through operations. By providing a unified, collaborative, and model-based platform, OpenSMAD reduces cost, time, and risk while accelerating innovation across the global space industry.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Mission:** To become the industry-standard platform for mission design by offering an accessible, extensible, and interoperable foundation for engineers, educators, and enterprises.

**Vision:** A future where anyone—from startups and universities to government agencies and aerospace primes—can design, analyze, and collaborate on space missions using a shared digital thread.

**Core Value Proposition:**

- ✅ **Integrated Design Environment** – Connect requirements, orbits, subsystems, and cost in real time.
- ✅ **Collaborative & Secure** – Role-based access, version control, and compliance-ready workflows.
- ✅ **Extensible via Open APIs** – Build custom plugins, integrate proprietary tools, and contribute to a growing ecosystem.
- ✅ **Educational & Adoption-Focused** – Tutorials, templates, and curriculum support for the next generation of space engineers.

| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Integrated Digital Mission Dashboard** | Real-time visualization of key parameters (ΔV, mass, power, cost, reliability) with automatic cross-disciplinary updates.          |
| **Collaborative Workspace**              | Cloud-native environment with role-based permissions, review workflows (SRR/PDR/CDR), and team versioning.                         |
| **Trade Study & Scenario Manager**       | Configure and execute batch simulations (1000s of permutations) with Pareto-front visualization and comparative analysis.          |
| **Library & Marketplace**                | Repository of verified models (orbits, components, environments) and a marketplace for community and commercial add-ons.           |
| **Reporting & Compliance Engine**        | Automated generation of standardized documentation (compliance matrices, proposal slides, ICDs) aligned with NASA/CCSDS templates. |
| **Open API & Plugin Ecosystem**          | Well-documented interfaces for custom modules, third-party integrations, and proprietary model ingestion.                          |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 16+ (for frontend components)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/opensmad/opensmad.git
cd opensmad

# Install backend dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Run development servers
# Backend (API & services)
python run.py

# Frontend (UI)
npm run dev
```

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Sign up / Log in** via the web interface.
2. **Choose a template** (e.g., Lunar CubeSat, LEO Constellation) or start from scratch.
3. **Explore the Dashboard** – edit parameters and watch the mission update in real time.
4. **Run a Trade Study** – vary inputs like altitude or mass to optimize your design.
5. **Generate a Report** – export a one-page summary or a full compliance matrix.

For detailed instructions, see our [Getting Started tutorial](https://docs.opensmad.org/getting-started).
