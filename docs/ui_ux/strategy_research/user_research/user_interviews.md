**Product/Service:** OpenSMAD (Open Space Mission Analysis and Design) – an integrated, open-core software ecosystem for end-to-end space mission design, from concept through operations.

**Target Users:** Enterprise Aerospace & Defense engineers, NewSpace startup engineers/systems architects, Academic researchers/educators, and Government/agency mission planners.

**Interview Goal:** To understand the current workflows, frustrations, and unmet needs in space mission design and analysis, and to identify what would motivate adoption of a new, integrated platform.

---

### **Interview Questions**

1.  Walk me through your current process for developing a mission concept from initial idea to a baseline design. What tools do you use at each stage?
2.  What are the biggest frustrations or bottlenecks you encounter during the mission design and analysis phase?
3.  How do you currently share design data and collaborate with team members or external partners? What works well and what doesn't?
4.  When evaluating a new software tool for mission design, what are the top 3-5 factors you consider? (e.g., cost, features, ease of use, support)
5.  How do you handle changes in requirements or design parameters? What is the impact of a late-stage change on your process?
6.  What capabilities do you wish you had that your current toolset doesn't provide?
7.  Imagine an ideal mission design platform. What would it allow you to do that you can't do easily today?

### **Simulated User Responses**

- **Enterprise A&D Engineer:** "Our process is fragmented. We use [Incumbent Tool A] for orbits, custom Excel sheets for sizing and cost, and another vendor's tool for thermal analysis. The biggest pain is transferring data between them – it's manual, error-prone, and we lose traceability. Collaboration means sending huge files via email or SharePoint. Top factors? Compliance with our internal digital engineering standards, proven reliability, and vendor support. A late-stage change is a nightmare; it takes weeks to re-sync all the models and reports."
- **NewSpace Startup CTO:** "We move fast and can't afford $100k licenses. We use a mix of open-source tools like GMAT and a lot of Python scripts. It works, but it's brittle. If our astrodynamics expert leaves, no one else can easily pick it up. Collaboration is just sharing code on GitHub. We prioritize low upfront cost, cloud access so the team can work from anywhere, and APIs so we can integrate with our own tools. We desperately need something that connects propulsion choice directly to cost and schedule automatically."
- **Academic Researcher/Professor:** "I use open-source tools for student projects and research because they're free and modifiable. But they are hard to install, poorly documented, and my students spend half the semester just getting the software to work instead of learning mission design. I need tools that are accessible for teaching but have the depth for real research. A discount is nice, but what I really need are good educational materials and curriculum integration."
- **Government Mission Planner:** "We need tools that ensure interoperability with our international partners and create auditable trails for decisions. We often have to use specific tools mandated by primes, which may not be the best technically. Procurement is a huge barrier to trying new things. An ideal platform would be a 'single source of truth' for a mission's digital twin, from the earliest studies all the way to ops, with strict version control and access management."

### **Key Insights**

**Needs:**

- **Integrated Digital Thread:** A seamless flow of data across all mission design disciplines (orbit, power, cost, etc.) to maintain consistency and traceability.
- **Lowered Barriers:** Affordable, accessible tools for education and small companies, reducing reliance on expensive licenses or fragile custom scripts.
- **Modern Collaboration:** Cloud-enabled, role-based workspaces for real-time collaboration within and across organizations, moving beyond file-sharing.
- **Agility & Flexibility:** Tools that support rapid iteration, easy scenario testing, and can adapt to changing requirements without massive rework.
- **Standardization & Interoperability:** Open APIs, common data formats, and compliance with emerging digital engineering standards to facilitate partnership and data exchange.

**Pain Points:**

- **Tool Fragmentation & Silos:** Using disconnected tools leads to manual data transfer, errors, and loss of a unified mission view.
- **High Cost & Complexity:** Enterprise tools are prohibitively expensive for non-traditional players, while open-source tools lack usability and support.
- **Poor Collaboration Workflows:** Current methods (email, shared drives) are inefficient, lack version control, and hinder cross-organizational work.
- **Inflexibility to Change:** Design changes are costly and time-consuming to propagate across a fragmented toolchain.
- **Steep Learning Curves & Talent Gap:** Tools are difficult to learn and use, creating a bottleneck and slowing down project onboarding and execution.

**Motivations:**

- **Risk Mitigation:** The primary driver for enterprises and government is reducing programmatic and technical risk through traceable, auditable design decisions.
- **Speed & Capital Efficiency:** For startups, the motivation is to accelerate development cycles, get to market faster, and conserve limited funding.
- **Educational Impact & Talent Development:** Academics are motivated by training the next generation with relevant, industry-applicable tools.
- **Strategic Autonomy & Innovation:** Government and industry leaders seek sovereign, flexible capabilities that are not locked into a single vendor's ecosystem.
- **Competitive Advantage:** All segments are motivated by gaining an edge through better, faster, more collaborative design processes enabled by modern software.
