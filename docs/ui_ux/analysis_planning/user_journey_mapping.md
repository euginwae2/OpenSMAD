| **1. Awareness & Setup**        | Alex researches tools to replace his patchwork of scripts and Excel. He hears about OpenSMAD through industry forums or a colleague.                 | - Industry blogs/forums.<br>- Colleague recommendation.<br>- OpenSMAD marketing website.<br>- Documentation portal.                                                         | - **High cost of alternatives** is a barrier.<br>- **Skepticism** about a new platform's robustness.<br>- **TBD:** Specific steps to find and evaluate OpenSMAD.                                                  | - Clear case studies showcasing startup success.<br>- Transparent pricing (freemium model) and feature comparison vs. incumbents.<br>- A lightweight, web-based demo to try without installation.                             | **Frustrated -> Hopeful**                 |
| **2. Onboarding & Initial Use** | He signs up for the free tier, accesses the cloud workspace, and attempts to create his first mission model or import existing data.                 | - Account sign-up page.<br>- Platform onboarding tour/tutorial.<br>- Main dashboard UI.<br>- Data import wizards (for CSV, GMAT outputs).<br>- Initial "Get Started" guide. | - **Fear of data lock-in** or complex migration.<br>- **Unclear how to map his existing scripts/Excel models** into the platform's structure.<br>- **TBD:** Specific onboarding flow for users with legacy data.  | - Pre-built templates for common mission types (e.g., LEO Constellation).<br>- Interactive walkthrough for first project setup.<br>- Clear documentation on data formats and import capabilities.                             | **Anxious -> Cautiously Optimistic**      |
| **3. Core Task Execution**      | He defines key trade study variables (number of satellites, orbital planes, payload specs). Configures and runs batch simulations. Analyzes results. | - Trade Study Manager UI.<br>- Scenario configuration panels.<br>- Visualization dashboard (charts, graphs, orbit viewer).<br>- Real-time parameter updates.                | - **Risk of the tool being too simplistic** or lacking needed fidelity for credible results.<br>- **Uncertainty about the validity** of the underlying models.<br>- **TBD:** How batch job progress is monitored. | - Inline access to model documentation and assumptions.<br>- Visual feedback during simulation runs.<br>- Ability to compare multiple scenarios side-by-side easily.                                                          | **Focused -> Engaged/Impatient**          |
| **4. Synthesis & Validation**   | Alex reviews the output data, checks for consistency, and iterates by adjusting parameters to explore the trade space further.                       | - Integrated Digital Mission Dashboard.<br>- Data export functions.<br>- "Save Scenario" feature.<br>- TBD: Validation checks or error flags.                               | - **Difficulty tracing how a high-level output** was derived from inputs (loss of context).<br>- **Manual work may still be needed** to transfer results to other tools for specific analyses.                    | - A "digital thread" view that links requirements to parameters to results.<br>- One-click reporting snapshots.<br>- Strong API access to pull data into external tools for niche analysis.                                   | **Analytical -> (Potentially) Satisfied** |
| **5. Collaboration & Sharing**  | He generates a polished report, shares the live mission model with his engineering team for review, and prepares materials for an investor deck.     | - Reporting & Compliance Engine.<br>- Collaborative workspace (shareable project link).<br>- Role-based access controls.<br>- Comment/annotation tools.                     | - **Concerns about sharing sensitive IP** on a cloud platform.<br>- **Investors may not have platform access** to view interactive results.<br>- **TBD:** How review feedback is incorporated into the model.     | - Robust access controls and permission settings.<br>- "Export to Presentation" feature creating self-contained, interactive views or animated visuals.<br>- Version history and change-tracking for collaborative iteration. | **Pressured -> Confident/Relieved**       |
| **6. Outcome & Next Steps**     | The trade study informs a go/no-go decision. Alex upgrades to a paid tier for advanced features or adds team seats as his company grows.             | - "Upgrade Plan" prompts or pages.<br>- Team management settings.<br>- Invoice/billing portal.<br>- Customer support channel.                                               | - **Potential friction in the upgrade process** or unclear ROI for paid features.<br>- **Scaling team access** might be administratively complex.                                                                 | - Clear, value-oriented communication about next-tier features (e.g., higher-fidelity models).<br>- Seamless team onboarding flows.<br>- Proactive support outreach after a period of heavy usage.                            | **Relieved -> Loyal/Advocate**            |

**Note:** Details regarding specific UI components, the exact sequence of onboarding, and the mechanics of certain features (e.g., model validation checks, detailed collaboration feedback loops) are marked as **TBD** as they are not explicitly defined in the provided resource documents.
