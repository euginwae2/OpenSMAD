### **3. Opportunities for Enhancement (Optional)**

- **For US-02:** Future enhancement could allow trade studies to incorporate **third-party high-fidelity plugins from the Marketplace** (e.g., a proprietary thermal analysis plugin) as part of the batch loop.
- **For US-07:** Future enhancement could include an **"Assumptions Log" pane** within the dashboard, showing the key assumptions driving the current numbers (e.g., "Cost based on NASA QuickCost model, 2025 dollars").
- **For US-04:** Future enhancement for the Enterprise tier could include **watermarking and viewership analytics** on shared links to track contractor engagement.
- **For US-05:** Enhancement could involve **interactive, gamified tutorials** within the example mission, guiding students through specific "what-if" scenarios.
